				<h3>Title</h3>
				<p>Trends and prospects for computer vision</p>
				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				<p>It is clear that the field of computer vision has changed significantly over the past decade or so - the number of researchers in the field has more than doubled and the commercial interest in computer vision is significant.  According to Chrunchbase, there are more than 150 startups worldwide working on various applications of computer vision. So, what has changed and what are the most promising research directions for the next decade?  This was the question posed to a group of the world’s leading computer vision and AI  researchers in Washington D.C. last November in a workshop organized with support from the U.S. Government to identify future research directions in computer vision.  I organized this workshop with the assistance of Profs. Devi Parikh of Virginia Tech and Fei-Fei Li of Stanford, and this talk will begin with an overview of the findings and recommendations of that workshop panel.  Not surprisingly, one of the dominating intellectual threads of that workshop was deep learning, which has become the dominant paradigm for many computer vision and AI problems.  In the second part of the talk I will discuss recent work in my group on new deep learning architectures for computer vision problems, including object detection, acquisition and utilization of contextual models for recognition, and learning binary codes that capture semantic properties of images. </p>

				<h3>Title</h3>
				<p>Interpreting Neural Semantics in Deep Models</p>
				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				<p>Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision. Many people believe that the success is due to employing a huge number of parameters to fit big training data. In this talk, I will show that neuron responses of deep models have clear semantic interpretation, which is supported by our research on multiple fields of face recognition, object tracking, human pose estimation, and crowd video analysis. In particular, the responses of neurons in the top layers have sparseness and strong selectiveness object classes, attributes and identities.  Sparseness and selectiveness are strongly correlated. Such selectiveness is naturally obtained through large scale training without adding extra regularization during the training process. By understanding neural semantics, we are inspired to develop new network architectures and training strategies and they effectively improve a broad range of applications in face recognition, face detection, compressing neural networks, object tracking, learned structured feature representation in human pose estimation, and effectively learning dynamic feature representations of different semantic units in video understanding. </p>
